Start ssh-agent/ssh-add only if you really use ssh or friends.

This script acts as a frontend for ssh-add and ssh-agent which asks you for
the passphrase automatically but only the first time you run ssh and friends.

The keychain script is supported if it is available
(a reasonable new version of that script is required).

To install this script simply copy it into your PATH.
You will want to set corresponding shell aliases in your shell:
To get a description run
	sshstart -h

You also need push.sh from http://github.com/vaeth/push in your path.

For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available by layman).
